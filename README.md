**Abstract:**
Let $\Gamma_X$ denote the family of compact subsets of $(X,d)$. A colouring $\chi : \Gamma_X \to [k]$ is *diametric* if every pair of compact subsets with equal diameters receive the same colour. A free ultrafilter $\mathcal{F}$ is called *diametrically Ramsey* if every diametric colouring admits a set $M \in \mathcal{F}$ whose compact subsets are monochrome. We show that every infinite ultrametric space contains a sequence $(x_n)$ such that any free ultrafilter containing $(x_n)$ is diametrically Ramsey, thereby extending a result of Protasov and Protasova [\[1\]](http://matstud.org.ua/texts/2018/49_2/115-121.pdf).
